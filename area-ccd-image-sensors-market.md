<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Area CCD Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interline Transfer</li><li>Frame Line Transfer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Area CCD image sensors are categorized into two main types: Interline Transfer and Frame Transfer. Interline Transfer sensors use a parallel structure that allows for simultaneous exposure and readout, enhancing efficiency and reducing motion blur, making them ideal for video applications. Frame Transfer sensors, on the other hand, alternate between capturing an image and reading it out, which can lead to increased sensitivity but results in a brief interruption during data transfer. Both types are crucial in different imaging applications.</p></p>
